**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo: browse items, add them
to a cart, and check out.

This repository is a fork of
[GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)
with upstream GCP deployment tooling **and GitHub Actions removed on purpose**.
Application source in [`src/`](./src) and the gRPC contract in
[`protos/`](./protos) are unchanged. The point of the fork is to rebuild
packaging, CI, Azure infrastructure, GitOps, and observability from scratch —
and to be able to defend every piece in an interview.

**Start here:** [4-day learn-by-doing sprint](./docs/4-day-roadmap.md)
(Codespaces, kind, Helm, GitHub Actions, Terraform/AKS, ArgoCD, Prometheus,
Grafana, and the README that turns the work into interviews).

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

| Service                                              | Language      | Description                                                                                                                       |

| [frontend](/src/frontend)                           | Go            | Exposes an HTTP server to serve the website. Does not require signup/login and generates session IDs for all users automatically. |
| [cartservice](/src/cartservice)                     | C#            | Stores the items in the user's shopping cart in Redis and retrieves it.                                                           |

| [currencyservice](/src/currencyservice)             | Node.js       | Converts one money amount to another currency. Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |
| [paymentservice](/src/paymentservice)               | Node.js       | Charges the given credit card info (mock) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID.                                     |
| [shippingservice](/src/shippingservice)             | Go            | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock)                                 |
| [emailservice](/src/emailservice)                   | Python        | Sends users an order confirmation email (mock).                                                                                   |
| [checkoutservice](/src/checkoutservice)             | Go            | Retrieves user cart, prepares order and orchestrates the payment, shipping and the email notification.                            |
| [recommendationservice](/src/recommendationservice) | Python        | Recommends other products based on what's given in the cart.                                                                      |
| [adservice](/src/adservice)                         | Java          | Provides text ads based on given context words.                                                                                   |
| [loadgenerator](/src/loadgenerator)                 | Python/Locust | Continuously sends requests imitating realistic user shopping flows to the frontend.                                              |

## Quickstart (Codespaces + kind)

Do **not** follow upstream GKE/Kustomize/Helm docs — those trees were deleted
so you can rebuild them. Full steps, interview notes, and a 4-day checklist:

**[docs/4-day-roadmap.md](./docs/4-day-roadmap.md)**

Shortest path to a running shop (Day 1):

1. Open this repo in a GitHub Codespace on the **2-core / 8 GB** machine.
   [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
   installs Docker-in-Docker, kubectl, Helm, kind, Terraform, and Azure CLI.
2. `kind create cluster --name boutique`
3. `kubectl apply -f release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`
4. `kubectl scale deploy/loadgenerator --replicas=0`
5. `kubectl port-forward deploy/frontend 8080:8080` and open the forwarded URL.

`release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml` uses Google's prebuilt images so the shop
comes up in minutes. You will replace that file with your own Helm chart and
GHCR images on Day 2.

## Additional deployment options

Upstream GCP-specific Terraform, Kustomize, Helm, Istio, Cloud Build, and
GitHub Actions were removed from this fork. Rebuild them in this order:

| Day | You write |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | kind cluster + break-it notes |
| 2 | `charts/boutique` + `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` |
| 3 | `infra/` Terraform → AKS |
| 4 | ArgoCD Application + Prometheus/Grafana + this README |
