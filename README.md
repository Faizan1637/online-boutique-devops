![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/workflows/Continuous%20Integration%20-%20Main/Release/badge.svg)

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application. The
application is a web-based e-commerce shop: browse items, add them to a cart,
and check out.

This repository is a fork of
[GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)
with upstream GCP deployment tooling removed (Helm, Kustomize, Terraform, Cloud
Build, DeployStack). Application source in [`src/`](./src) and the gRPC contract
in [`protos/`](./protos) are unchanged. The goal is to rebuild packaging, CI,
Azure infrastructure, GitOps, and observability from scratch.

**Read this first if you need to explain the shop in an interview:**
[Storefront breakdown](./docs/storefront-breakdown.md) — Add to Cart, checkout,
service discovery (DNS + env vars), and what happens when a backend dies.

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

microservices](/docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)](/docs/img/architecture-diagram.png)

## Quickstart (GKE)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone the latest major version.

   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 --branch v0 https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.git
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

   The `--depth 1` argument skips downloading git history.

3. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Substitute `<PROJECT_ID>` with the ID of your Google Cloud project.

4. Create a GKE cluster and get the credentials for it.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create-auto online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Creating the cluster may take a few minutes.

5. Deploy Online Boutique to the cluster.

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

6. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   adservice-76bdd69666-ckc5j               1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   cartservice-66d497c6b7-dp5jr             1/1     Running   0          2m59s
   checkoutservice-666c784bd6-4jd22         1/1     Running   0          3m1s
   currencyservice-5d5d496984-4jmd7         1/1     Running   0          2m59s
   emailservice-667457d9d6-75jcq            1/1     Running   0          3m2s
   frontend-6b8d69b9fb-wjqdg                1/1     Running   0          3m1s
   loadgenerator-665b5cd444-gwqdq           1/1     Running   0          3m
   paymentservice-68596d6dd6-bf6bv          1/1     Running   0          3m
   productcatalogservice-557d474574-888kr   1/1     Running   0          3m
   recommendationservice-69c56b74d4-7z8r5   1/1     Running   0          3m1s
   redis-cart-5f59546cdd-5jnqf              1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
   ```

7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Online Boutique.

8. Congrats! You've deployed the default Online Boutique. For how a click
   in that UI fans out across gRPC services, see the
   [storefront breakdown](./docs/storefront-breakdown.md).

9. Once you are done with it, delete the GKE cluster.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters delete online-boutique \
     --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
   ```

   Deleting the cluster may take a few minutes.

## Additional deployment options

Upstream GCP-specific Terraform, Kustomize, Helm, and Istio trees were removed
from this fork. What remains for a first deploy:

- **Any Kubernetes cluster (kind, minikube, AKS, GKE):** apply
  [`release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml`](./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml).
  It points at Google's prebuilt images so the shop comes up without building
  all 11 services. On kind, port-forward the frontend instead of waiting for
  `frontend-external`'s LoadBalancer.
- **Local iteration from source:** [Development guide](/docs/development-guide.md)
  (`skaffold.yaml` is still in the repo).
- **How the running shop behaves:** [Storefront breakdown](./docs/storefront-breakdown.md).
